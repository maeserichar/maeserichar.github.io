 Hello there!

 My name is Ricardo, a software engineer, musician and sociology student based in Spain. Between the topics that interest me (and that I expect to write about sooner or later) you can find technology, politics, privacy and the interactions between technology and society.

 Opening (or re-opening) this blog is my try at going back to the "old" internet, out of the walled gardens, more decentralized (and/or federated), as a mean of self-expression. I will try to explore topics about the fediverse and indieweb (and if possible, put then into practice in this website).

 Well, welcome to my humble home, hope you will enjoy your stay!
